Welcome to my blog, Svenlaa.com, I'm Sven.

Here you can soon find my posts about stuff that interests me. You can expect
posts about books, Japanese, anime, programming, plants, my daily life and whatever else is on my mind. I am new to
this, and I intend to write around once a week. Please check back
or [use RSS once it's available](https://github.com/Svenlaa/home-v2/issues/2). You can find this project project
on [GitHub](https://github.com/Svenlaa/home-v2) for future plans and version history of blogposts.

### Technical site details

The stack is inspired by how [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) is used, but there's no server for HTMX to do its job.

- [@kitajs/html](https://github.com/kitajs/html) uses JSX for HTML templating without the need for React.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is like inline classes on steroids, it's very powerful and you don't have to
  switch files.
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) is a set of attributes that allow you to write JS in your components. It's Tailwind
  for JS.
- [Marked](https://marked.js.org/) and [parse-md](https://github.com/rpearce/parse-md) are used for the blog in
  Markdown.
- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) are simple to work with in this diet-js app and are just one class.
