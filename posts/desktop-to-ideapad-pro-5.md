longTitle: Desktop to Laptop, a Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 review
createdAt: 2024-03-09

A couple of weeks ago I bought a brand-new laptop, the Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5. I have a nearly 5-year-old custom desktop
with an Intel i5-7400, 1050Ti and 8GB RAM. I recently moved and found myself using the **old** laptop. It's tiny and
slow, but found myself using it a lot.

I moved house, and it seems a laptop fits in with how I use my new space. There is no desk anymore in the living room. I
have a small room upstairs, but that'd require separate heating. I'm learning that heating is costly. Additionally, I'd
also like to have a laptop for portability. I'd go to the library for a focus boost.

## Input

### Keyboard

The keyboard is small and misses some keys. That is to be expected on a 14-inch device, with speakers on either side. I
would still have loved Home, End, PageUp, PageDown buttons instead of them being hidden behind the Fn + Arrow keys. It
has a backlight, with two brightness options. It's nice in the evening, although a simple lamp fulfills the same
purpose. With a lamp you can even pick the colour temperature to be a bit warmer in the evening. The keyboard has a US
layout, which is a must. I like the long enter and long left-shift keys.

### Trackpad

I have barely used a mouse. All I need to use can be done with the trackpad. The gestures are simple to learn, as they
are adapted from mobile.

Tap to click, Two-finger tap to right-click, Three-finger tap to middle-click. Swipe to move the mouse. Swipe with
two-finger to scroll, or go back/forward (not supported everywhere). Three-finger swipe-up to see all open apps,
three-finger horizontal-swipe to switch desktops.

## Output

### Screen

The screen is a 14 inch 16:10 1400px 60Hz screen.
The screen size has a perfect balance. It's a 14-inch screen but a little taller than most.
I take advantage of the extra height by using the Linux top bar, and fitting more text on the screen. A drawback is its
high resolution of 1400p, or 2.2K as Lenovo calls it. It requires me to set scaling to 125%. Fractional scaling on
Fedora isn't fully supported, but you
can [enable fractional scaling](https://www.omglinux.com/how-to-enable-fractional-scaling-fedora) with a simple command.
I don't use my laptop outside, nor do I know colour accuracy. Thus, I will not comment on it. I use night light during
the day.

### Speakers

I like to listen to music, and that works fine on this device. YouTube videos are also perfectly understandable. The
IdeaPad boasts Dolby Atmos on the front of it, but I don't have the knowledge to comment on that. I don't like that it's
painted on the front. You can't remove it like you can with the CPU and GPU stickers. I like my LinkBuds S better than
the speakers. I like the noise-cancelling and they are pretty convenient. You can connect them via Bluetooth.

## Software

### Operating System (OS)

I went through the Windows setup for the Lenovo specific stuff. It might've updated the BIOS or something. After that, I
installed GNU/Linux Fedora on the device. I had a problem with the IdeaPad not coming out of suspend, but that was
easily fixed by updating the software. I like Linux because it can run on the server and laptop. Having the same OS on
both devices is really nice. I started out with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, so I'm pretty familiar with the OS and the terminal.

### Customization

I have a few extensions installed. Some make the top bar more useful. Others make the entire system look better. I
wanted the top bar to be functional, without it being too busy.

- [AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/) adds
  App Indicators to the top bar. App Indicators are those small apps on the right side of the Windows toolbar. Examples
  are the JetBrains Toolbox and Steam.
- [Compact Top Bar](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5669/compact-top-bar/) is pretty obvious. It makes the top
  bar smaller.
- [Workspaces indicator by open apps](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5967/workspaces-indicator-by-open-apps/)
  shows your open apps and desktops, similar to the Windows toolbar. You can click
  on them or scroll to change desktop. Changing desktops is irrelevant to me. A trackpad gesture is way better. I
  customized the look to be more minimal.
- [Media Controls](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4470/media-controls/) shows your music in the top bar, and
  gives you very simple, customizable controls.
- [Vitals](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1460/vitals/) gives you information about resource usage in the top
  bar. You can pick the items to display yourself. I have it show CPU%, RAM%, Max Temperature and remaining battery
  time.
- [Blur My Shell](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3193/blur-my-shell/) changes your backdrop for certain Gnome
  pages. It switches out the default gray tone with a blurred, darkened version of your wallpaper. You can customize the
  values.

## Conclusion

I really like the move to the IdeaPad. There were a few bumps, but those were figured out quickly. I like the device,
especially the form-factor, its portability and the power. I'm happy with the customization, and will continue to
improve it. I'm sure it will stay me for quite a few years. Please do contact me
